    # - paragraph:
    #     - line: The Trento-Innsbruck Quantum Information Tour is finally coming back with TIQIT25!
    # - paragraph:
    #     - line: The event will have a focus on Bose-Einstein Condensation, Nanoscience, Quantum Optics and Quantum Information. The language of the talks will be English.
    #     - line: Students will be given lectures on forefront theoretical and experimental research in this fields by academics and prominent figures in Trento and Innsbruck environment.
    - paragraph:
        - line: GIPE (German Italian Physics Exchange) is an international twinning project based on conferences which aims to link more and more IAPS (International Association of Physics Students) students.
        - line: In particular, GIPE gathers German and Italian students. The project's organization operates on several levels such as, the presentation of the research activities provided by the host institution and the peer-to-peer sharing of the experiences lived by the young researchers. During your stay, AISF Trieste provides you for visits to laboratories and research facilities, both university and private, with moments of direct confrontation with experts. There will also be some spaces granted to companies, who want to participate in the project, to exhibit activities and job offers they propose. Among the various activities we want to give space to the visit of laboratories, as to present the different areas of physics to which a graduate or graduating physics can look out for the future. In the same way, as will be discussed in more detail later, the local committee has taken care to ensure some fruitful moments of sociability, mainly oriented towards the scientific field that can favor a free exchange of opinions among students.
