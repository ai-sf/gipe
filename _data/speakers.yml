  seminar_description:
    - The talk will introduce the role of solid-state detectors in High-Energy Physics (HEP) experiments and neighbouring scientific fields. The key components and technological challenges involved in developing silicon detectors for such applications will be discussed, with focus on the tracking detectors used in HEP experiments. Examples will include innovative developments for next-generation, high-precision experiments—such as the ALICE upgrades and the ePIC detector. Finally, the talk will present the advanced facilities being established at the Department of Physics of the University of Trieste, part of the Department of Excellence initiative, which aim to enhance interdisciplinary detector development, and support advanced teaching in the field of instrumentation in the various curricula of the Master's Degree in Physics.

  seminar_title: Second law of thermodynamics and Fluctuation Theorems
  seminar_description:
    - In microscopic systems in contact with external baths the size of the thermal fluctuations can be as large as the average system energy.
      Thus, as an example, microscopic engines are not simple rescaled versions of their macroscopic counterparts, and a statistical thermodynamic description is needed, if one wants to characterize properly the relevant thermodynamical quantities.
    - In this respect stochastic thermodynamics  provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamic quantities such as work, heat and entropy  to the level of individual trajectories for microscopic systems both at equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium.
    - In this framework  work, heat and entropy become fluctuating quantities, and the fluctuation theorems describe the constraints on such fluctuations, extending the second law of thermodynamics to microscopic out-of-equilibrium systems.
    - In my lecture I will review the recent extension of the second law to the microscopic realm and discuss a few examples of microscopic out-of-equilibrium systems.

    - Quantum computers hold the promise of solving problems that are intractable with classical resources, and atoms—nature's ideal qubits—are at the forefront of this revolution.
    - "In this talk, we will explore how individual atoms can be isolated, manipulated, and entangled to perform quantum computations. I will introduce the main experimental platforms based on neutral atoms and trapped ions, highlighting the physics that enables precise qubit control, logic operations, and scalability. We'll also take a look inside the lab: what does a quantum computer built from atoms actually look like? From optical tweezers and ultra-high vacuum chambers to laser systems and control electronics, I'll guide you through the key components and challenges of this cutting-edge technology. Finally, we will discuss the future directions and open questions on the path toward building large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum machines."

  seminar_title: "100 Years of Quantum Mechanics: A History of Understanding What Cannot Be Seen"
  seminar_description:
    - This talk traces the extraordinary journey of quantum mechanics over the past century, from the earliest atomic models to the profound conceptual revolutions that reshaped our understanding of reality. Beginning with Dalton's atomic hypothesis and culminating in Schrödinger's wave mechanics, the presentation highlights the progressive realization that matter exhibits both particle and wave-like behaviors. It then explores the deep philosophical and physical implications of quantum theory, focusing on the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and Bell's theorem, culminating in the experimental confirmation of quantum nonlocality. The final part of the talk addresses modern quantum technologies—including quantum computing, communication, and sensing—emphasizing how the fragility of quantum states is being harnessed for transformative technological applications. As we celebrate the International Year of Quantum in 2025, this retrospective not only honors a century of discovery but also looks ahead to a quantum-enabled future.

  seminar_title: 'The Phases of Nature: Emergence and Universality '
  seminar_description:
    - "“More is different,” as P. W. Anderson famously remarked. The collective behavior of many elementary objects, whether particles, atoms, molecules, people, or even bits of information, can be profoundly different from the behavior of each one in isolation. These emergent properties manifest themselves in the physical world through phase transitions separating two or more phases. In some phases, the elementary components act independently without producing a macroscopic change; in others, they cooperate to generate new, collective behavior. A familiar example is the transition of water into ice as the temperature drops: below freezing, water molecules align to form a crystalline structure. This paradigm extends far beyond traditional physical systems. Comparable mechanisms underlie a wide range of phenomena in physics, information science, and even social dynamics. Phase transitions arise as a natural consequence of the interaction among large numbers of components, where the specific details of each element often become irrelevant. Phase transitions thus illustrate how the richness of nature emerges from cooperation at scale, demonstrating that the whole can indeed be more than the sum of its parts."
